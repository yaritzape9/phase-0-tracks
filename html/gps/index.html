<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	To give both the coder and the browser a clear definition of what is going to happen. I say the table and the form tags are the most useful just because I can see myself using those when I make more html pages.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	It goes from the first line of code to the last.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	That you can make certain parts of coding faster and more efficient. Like the snippets and I do think I'll make more just because it helps save time.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The most challenging part of this challenge was at first the tables. I wasn't very sure about it at first. I was able to ask questions and get a clear definition.
