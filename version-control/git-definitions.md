# Git Definitions of Concepts

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Its a way for you to keep track of the changes in your code. When
you want to update anything version control keeps the old copies,
therefore if you were to make a mistake, you could revert back.
Developers can use it by reviewing history, wanting to see the
difference of the two versions.
	
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is a copy of the original code that you can play/work
	with and make changes to. This way you can keep various coders
	work serpertly so its easier to work with.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Commit helps you captures what you changed but it helps you write
	messages to explain why you did it. Specific commit messages help
	other coders understand your changes therefore practicing specific
	commit messages helps benefit you.
	
* What is a merge conflict?

	When two coders are changing the same line in the same file, git doesn;t know which one is the correct modification so git will throw this merge conflict error.
