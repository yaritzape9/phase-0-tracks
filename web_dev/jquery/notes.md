i want to find website that give me tutorials and ways to figure out what I can do 
with jquery. From those examples I want to look up how I can achieve those and learn from
that. I still have yet to know what I can do with jquery therefore looking up examples 
and what I can do will help. W3 schools and code academy help a lot. Also MDN! In two 
hours i feel like halfway I should take a 10min break to help me snap out of my focused 
self and just have a fresh new perspective after a break. So yes they are important.
Again I plan to tackle this in just looking up tutorials or examples to help
me play around with it and to start to understand.

START!
So for the next two hours I will research how to make text blink and bounce just 
because I feel like those are cool.
Breaks helped. MDN and W3 schools helped sooooo much! Helped me with examples and really 
understanding everything.
