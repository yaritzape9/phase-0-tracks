The Linux philosophy is epitomized by the ease with which one can open a terminal
 emulator to access the CLI and its concomitant power. It allows you to have the power 
 to do things without asking yes or no. It assumes you know what your doing. Although it
  does limit how much you can do as a user because you dont have access to everything
  as a user. Root has access to everything!!!! The emulators cool in the fact that
  anyone can play with it and have fun with customizing it.

root is like the man without limits with linux so anything done with root is said and
done and it has no restrictions. No are you sure because if you are the root it assumes
you know what your doing and that your always sure.

Also VPS are useful because you have control over the machine 
and donâ€™t necessarily have to run machine.
