# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Conor Burke].
# We spent [#49] mins on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Require_relative looks up the file name in the local directory.
# It is analogous to copying/importing the data in that file and
# pasting it in the current file.  Require looks up the full path
# in the Ruby file-tree.

require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor
  # runs when an instance of VirusPredictor is create and takes
  # and sets the three parameters to those instance variables
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end

  # a way to call those two methods with those specific arguments
  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread
  end

  private

  # evaluates the population_density and then executes a 
  # calculation and prints out first half of message
  def predicted_deaths
    # predicted deaths is solely based on population density
    if @population_density >= 200
      death_factor = 0.4
    elsif @population_density >= 150
      death_factor = 0.3
    elsif @population_density >= 100
      death_factor = 0.2

      death_factor = 0.1
    else
      death_factor = 0.05
    end
    number_of_deaths = (@population * death_factor).floor
    print "#{@state} will lose #{number_of_deaths} people in this outbreak"

  end

  # evaluates the population_density and increments the speed
  # variable based on that evaluation.  prints second half of 
  # message
  def speed_of_spread #in months
    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.
    speed = 0.0

#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section
# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
  #they are nested therefore the format looks different.
# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
    #require relative looks up a file in the local directory. And require looks up the whole path in the file tree.
# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
  # the .each method is a great way of iterating through a hash and or a loop.
# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
  # that intances dont have to be in the parameters because they are instances.
# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# instances and scopes of variables
